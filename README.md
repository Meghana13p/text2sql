The Text-to-SQL project is a Python-based application that enables users to convert natural language queries into SQL queries automatically. This tool facilitates database querying for users who may not be familiar with SQL syntax, allowing them to interact with databases using plain English or other natural languages.

Key Features:
Natural Language Understanding: Uses NLP techniques to interpret user input expressed in everyday language.

SQL Query Generation: Translates natural language requests into SQL commands that can be executed on relational databases.

Database Integration: Connects with various SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) to run generated queries.

Streamlit Web Interface: Provides an intuitive, interactive web app front-end that users can access via browser.

Environment Configuration: Uses .env files to securely manage sensitive database credentials.

Dependency Management: Includes a requirements.txt for easy installation of necessary Python packages.

Extensibility: Modular design to allow incorporation of more advanced models, support for complex queries, or additional NLP features.
